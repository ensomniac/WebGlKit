This tool is intended to be used on WebGL builds produced by Unity. It creates a better wrapper around content and provides an interface for communication between the browser and Unity.

# Getting Started
Clone this repo & install the tool:

+ git clone https://github.com/ensomniac/WebGlKit.git
+ python WebGlKit/setup.py

# Once Unity finishes building a WebGL scene, navigate to the build path and run this script:
+ cd /path/to/unity/webgl/build
+ webglkit
